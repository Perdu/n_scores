If you want to install the app on your server:
- create database by executing database.sql;
- In your crontab, add lines to execute auto_download.py every hour
  with option --fill-score-unique every hour and with option
  --fill-score every day. --fill-score downloads a copy of all scores
  every time, so you don't want to execute it too often. On the other
  hand, --fill-score-unique only downloads new scores (we need both
  tables in the database to speed up calculations)
  Add something like this (this will also save one .hs file per day):
00 * * * * python /path/to/n_scores/auto_download.py --fill-score-unique >/dev/null
05 05 * * * cd /path/to/save/hs_files/ && python /path/to/n_scores/auto_download.py --fill-score --save-hs-file
- for the web app:
  - install flask
  - fill config.py.example and rename it config.py
  - run index.py:
python index.py
